# bbc-web-test
News site that renders random articles and gives the user the ability to rank them, once all have been read. This project is for the BBC Software Engineering placement 2019. This project uses ReactJS along with create-react-app.

Each time the site is hard refreshed 5 articles are fetched from the BBC provided dataset https://github.com/bbc/news-coding-test-dataset

The order is then randomised and loaded into the React application allowing the user to freely navigate them.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to complete the ranker functionality however I had a plan on how to implement it using a ranker component. This component would've allowed the user to drag and drop article thumbnails in an order from best to worst, however they could go back to the previous articles to make a final decision.

The planning notes I made can be viewed on my Trello Board which is linked down below.


I'm applying for the Web and Backend trainee positions.
